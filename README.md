# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl

## Abstract

For this project, my team and I decided to work on a Kaggle project. Kaggle is a platform where data scientists from all around the world come together to solve data science, machine learning, and predictive analytics problems. For our project, we decided to participate in the NFL Big Data Bowl project. The goal of this project was to develop a model to predict how many yards a NFL player will gain after receiving a handoff. Having little to no knowledge of machine learning, my team and I decided to take multiple machine learning approaches towards this problem. We tried different modelling techniques such as Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Gaussian Mixture, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. After doing some more research, we found out that many of these techniques are not the best approach for this specific problem; however, we managed to get some good predictions using a combination of the Gaussian Mixture Model and the Random Forest Model. Although some of the modeling techniques did not give us the desired results, we managed to vastly expand our knowledge about machine learning approaches and their applications in other areas of Data Science.
